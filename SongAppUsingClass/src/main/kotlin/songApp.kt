// CLASS CONSTRUCTOR.
// although it looks similar to a function, the "constructor" is what's used to create an object
// e.g. Song(...args..) is a constructor as it results in an object being created from the class
// a constructor contains the code needed to initialize an object
// it runs way before the object is assigned a reference variable
// it defines properties and initializes them inside the object created
// each class comes with a constructor to help create the objects
// the constructor is the class' parentheses and the code in it --> by default, it's called a "primary constructor"
// during object creation, the constructor assigns a value to each of the properties (in the parentheses) --> initialization
// each class property is a local variable in the object (created through this class)
// *** a property is a variable thatâ€™s local to the object ***
// the values passed are assigned to these local variables/properties.
// properties defined using val cannot be assigned new values, while those defined with var, can be assigned new values

// objects are referred to as "instances of a class"
// properties are "instance variables"
