// INHERITANCE: involves;
// -> putting common code in one class (superclass)
// -> then allowing more specific classes (subclass) to inherit this code
// in case of any update, you only have to update the superclass & the changes will be reflected in all its subclasses.
// subclasses inherit all the properties & functions of their superclass
// e.g. superclass: Car, subclass: ConvertibleCar
// subclasses can have/ add specific properties & functions of their own
// they can also tweak some of the properties & functions they inherit from the superclass; this is called "overriding"
// *** A superclass contains common properties and functions that are inherited by one or more subclasses ***
// *** A subclass can include extra properties and functions, and can override the things that it inherits ***
